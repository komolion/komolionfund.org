Mason Everett serves as the chief information officer and a member of the board of directors for Komolion Human Development Fund. Mason was first introduced to the Komolion charitable effort through his visit to Kenya with the Baylor University Men’s Choir in 2013, the summer after his freshman year at Baylor. Since that trip, Mason has continued to serve the people of Kenya and the Men’s Choir through monetary donations and service, including serving as the president of the Men's Choir his senior year at Baylor. After being mentored by Dr. Randall Bradley at Baylor, Mason discovered a passion for developing leadership qualities in others. He is always looking for ways to use his proficiency with technology to serve people that do not have the opportunities that Mason has been blessed with. Mason is now a technology solutions architect with Credera and lives with his wife Amber in New York City.
