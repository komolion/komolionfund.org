Brenda Bradley serves as the vice president and a member of the board of
directors for Komolion Human Development Fund. Brenda has participated
in mission work internationally and locally since first serving on a
mission team to Torreon, Mexico in 1984, and she has helped lead student
and volunteer groups with Randall, her husband, since then. Brenda is a
professor of English at McLennan Community College and has been an
educator since 1982. She believes her life’s calling has been to
motivate and inspire students to find purpose and fulfillment through
the tool of education, particularly those from unconventional and
underserved backgrounds. Frequently finding ways to connect her
community college students to learning projects internationally, she has
been a guest teacher in places from Kazakhstan to Kenya. The experiences
and people she has encountered in her travels have also inspired much of
her poetry.
