Kajiado is a town about 50 miles south of Nairobi, Kenya. We have been involved with the Africa Inland Church boarding
school for girls there, as well as with a school for physically and intellectually challenged children on the same
campus. The Baylor Men’s Choir has sung for the students and teachers and brought T-shirts to the students on more than
one occasion. In 2013 the men painted a number of dormitories and the main dining hall and kitchen and installed gutters
on an office building.

In 2017 the men’s choir also visited Grace Nana Primary School in Kajiado. Both AIC and Grace Nana educate girls who
have been rescued from FGM, which is widely practiced by the dominant Maasai tribe in Kajiado County.
