In addition to supporting education for Komolion girls and boys, Komolion Fund continues to support other schools around
Kenya.

##### Hope Education Hub School, Kibera
Led by Isabel Omondi, Hope Education Hub School has more than 150 students and operates in Kibera, the largest urban
slum in Africa. Most of these children's families earn less than $2 a day and Hope Education Hub School provides a
quality education, meals, and care.

##### Africa Inland Church (AIC) Boarding School, Kajiado
About 50 miles south of Nairobi, the Baylor Men’s Choir has sung for students and teachers and brought T-shirts to
students at the AIC Boarding School. In 2013, the men painted a number of dormitories and the main dining hall and
kitchen and installed gutters on an office building.

##### Grace Nanana Primary School, Kajiado
Along with AIC, Grace Nanana educates girls who have been rescued from female genital mutilation, which is widely
practiced by the dominant Maasai tribe in Kajiado County. In 2017, the Baylor Men's Choir visited Grace Nanana and
Komolion Fund continues to support Grace Nanana financially. At the end of 2019, the school had 75 students (mostly
girls) and is consistently growing.
