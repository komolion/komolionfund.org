##### What is Female Genital Mutilation?
Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) is a cultural custom practiced by some groups
in Africa, the Middle East, and parts of South Asia. The custom goes back
hundreds of years. Though it is not officially sanctioned by any sacred text,
the ritual is practiced by numerous religious groups, including Christians and
Muslims.

##### What happens during the FGM ritual?
Girls (infants – 15) are held down while part of their genitalia are cut off,
without sanitation or painkillers. At a minimum the clitoris is removed. In
some cultures the entire genital area is cut off and sewn up, leaving only a
small hole for urination and menstruation.

##### Who performs the ritual?
A community has a ritual practitioner, usually an older woman, who performs the
cutting with a razor or other sharp instrument on several children in one
ceremony.

##### Why does this happen?
The purpose is to control female sexuality to guarantee virginity before
marriage and fidelity after marriage. Regardless of age, a girl must be cut
before she is eligible for marriage.

##### What are the consequences?
FGM causes psychological and physical trauma, excessive bleeding which is
sometimes fatal, infection, PTSD, depression, fistulas, extreme pain in
intercourse and death in childbirth. The World Health Organization has declared
the practice a human rights violation and abuse of children.

##### Is FGM legal?
Legal progress has been made in recent years, as Kenya and other countries have
made FGM an illegal practice along with marriage before the age of 18. However,
enforcement is near impossible in remote areas like the village of Komolion in
East Pokot. Yet even recently in Nairobi, the largest and capital city of
Kenya, a girl of 10 was rescued in the middle of a marriage ceremony.

##### How can we move communities toward change?
Research has demonstrated that the most effective way to reduce FGM in a
community is an alternative rite of passage. This new ritual must be planned
and carried out by the community itself. It also must be recognized as a valid
mode of transition to womanhood by the potential husbands of the community.
This is the approach we use in Komolion, in East Pokot, Kenya. In 2016 alone,
45 young women went through this ceremony. Plans continue for this ceremony to
replace FGM in Komolion for years to come.
