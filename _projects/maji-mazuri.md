Maji Mazuri, which means “good water” in Swahili, is a large non-profit organization in Nairobi with several different
ministries.

Komolion Human Development Project groups regularly visit the residential center for mentally disabled children. These
children are unable to care for themselves and their working parents cannot leave them at home alone or care for their
needs. At the center they receive therapy, good food, and loving care from staff and volunteers.
