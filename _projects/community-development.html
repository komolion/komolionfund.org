  With funds raised at a special chapel service, the Baylor Men’s Choir was able to provide new desks for students and
  teachers in the village school and to repair a wall in one of the school buildings. They were able to buy chickens so
  village women could sell eggs and to provide beehives so the men could collect and sell honey. The students and
  villagers also set up a garden, but it was destroyed by a flood in 2018. A doctor accompanied the 2017 Men’s Choir
  trip and conducted a clinic in the village. Brenda Bradley raised funds to buy shoes for village children.

  In 2019 another group of Baylor music students visited Komolion. With funds the students raised and money from
  Komolion Human Development Fund, the village was provided with beans and rice, children’s underwear, washable
  menstrual kits, pencils and erasers for schoolchildren, and medicines for a one-day clinic staffed by Kenyan
  providers. The students also helped replace a cement floor in a school building. The Fund built a residence for two
  teachers to live in the village, expanded the kitchen where the children’s lunches are prepared, provided treadle
  sewing machines for two girls training as tailors and paid them to make new school uniforms for all village boys. The
  group also brought 300 girls’ dresses made by women in the US.

  We will be able to continue with community development work only if we can continue to raise funds beyond what is
  needed for the girls’ tuition and for the coming-of-age ceremonies that substitute for female genital mutilation.
